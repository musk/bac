This is a repository to track files and templates for the blender animation challenge (BAC) hosted in the contest forum at http://www.blenderartists.org.
The intent of the BAC is to give people a chance to practice and develope their animation skills in a friendly contest.

Each challenge gives a task that all participants have to complete within a time period of three to four weeks.
The rules for each challenge can be read in the Template.txt file that accompanies the tagged version for the BAC.
So for BAC#1 you can find the rules in the Template.txt that is tagged with BAC#1.
The same holds true for the used base file.
