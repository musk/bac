Animation Challenge #53 Entries OPEN





Hi all,

I'm going to host this round of the animation challenge instead of Aligorith. 
Congratulation to last rounds winner padfoot7726. Although bittersweet, he was the only one to send in a complete entry, it was well deservered.
This rounds theme is: [b]The Big Top (the circus)[/b]

Entries will close in 3 weeks (7th July at 6pm or 18:00 GMT), at which point we'll vote for a week.
Remember to use your time wisely, and keep it simple (longer entries will take longer to make).

Hope to see more entries this time. 
Good luck to you all and happy blending

Musk
